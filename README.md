A CLI based virtual assistant to make life easier. Works through NLP.

**NOTE**: As said in the sounds of music, let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start
- This project is in its initial phase. Some predecided favourable aims are mentioned down below, which are just a vision to begin with this project.

## Aim
- It will work as a cli-assistant running in the background.
- It will take a wide range of queries and execute them.
- Will try the good algorithms of NLP and shall also be using some AI techniques wherever needed.
- Will work in text mode ( through commands ) and also in speech mode ( in background, while running other applications)
- Can do plenty of pre-decided API linked works, have to increase the efficiency.

## Contributing
Any suggestion, idea, collaborations are welcome and appreciated.
